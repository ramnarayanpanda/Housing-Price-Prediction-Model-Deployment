To run a specific env using tox: tox -e env_name 

To run all the sub envs inside a env: tox 


In the Heroku deployments  
i>   First create a app using "heroku create"
     NOTE: When the app is being created heroku checks the requirements.txt file to install all the packages, so here test_requirements.txt file wont be installed, 
     BE AWARE OF THAT.
ii>  Go to the folder where your project is present. Open cmd there.
     We need to push only the house_price_api subtree to the heroku app,
     run:  "git subtree push --prefix house_price_api heroku main"
iii> Also you can use curl comand generated in the app to call the prediction from any linux env running locally or virtually.
iv>  TO get the saved logs of the last push in heroku, you can run:  heroku logs --trail 
     You can use these logs to check in case there are any errors.

Procfile: It is necessary to deploy your app to heroku, It specifies the
          commands to run our app.
          web: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
          
          uvicorn: our web server 
          app.main:app:  app(folder).main(module):app(instance of out FastAPI)
          --port $PORT: You can not specify custom port here, heroku dynamically assigns a port. 


Now we dont want to run git push to heroku manually everytime we run our app. So we need to automate this.
Also we need to publish our own model (here we used the model tid-regression-model==3.0.3 in the req.txt file), version the model, training your model.
